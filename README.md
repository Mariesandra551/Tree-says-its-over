# Early Warning System for the Greek Financial Crisis

## Overview
This project develops a simple, interpretable **early warning system** to detect rising financial risk before the outbreak of the **Greek sovereign debt crisis**.  
By combining **economic theory** with **machine learning**, the model uses fiscal and market indicators—such as deficits, debt-to-GDP, and bond yield spreads—to predict the likelihood of a crisis period.

The emphasis is on **clarity and interpretability**, showing how even basic machine learning tools can complement economic reasoning for crisis forecasting.

## Objectives
- Build a transparent **early-warning system** for financial instability in Greece.
- Identify which **macroeconomic and market indicators** signal rising risk.
- Demonstrate how **machine learning** can enhance economic analysis without overcomplicating it.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation (`model.py`)
- Reads multiple `.csv` files from `/data`
- Automatically detects header rows
- Cleans, renames, and merges data into a single dataset
- Outputs `merged_cleaned_dataset.csv`

### 2. Model Training (`train_model.py`)
- Loads the cleaned dataset
- Creates a binary **crisis label**
- Balances the dataset through upsampling
- Imputes missing values and scales features
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classifier
- Evaluates results using accuracy and classification metrics
- Saves model artifacts (`.pkl` files) for reuse

### 3. Prediction Visualization (`Visualize_predictions.py`)
- Loads trained model and preprocessing tools
- Predicts **crisis probabilities** for each observation
- Displays top 10 highest-risk years or countries
- Saves both `.csv` and `.png` outputs for presentation

## Results

- The model successfully identifies periods where **fiscal imbalance** and **market stress** coincide with high crisis probability.
- Key predictive features include:
  - Deficit-to-GDP ratio
  - Debt-to-GDP ratio
  - Bond yield spreads (Greek vs. German)
- The visualization highlights years that markets perceived as high-risk before the official crisis.

## Interpretation
The project demonstrates that even with basic data and a simple logistic regression, it is possible to detect **early warning signs** of financial distress.  
The model should not be viewed as a predictor of exact crises but as a **decision-support tool** that highlights periods of rising vulnerability.

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|
| Limited and inconsistent historical data | Used data cleaning and median imputation |
| Small dataset | Applied upsampling of crisis observations |
| Correlated variables | Chose interpretable indicators and simple models |
| Asymmetric information | Relied on market-based indicators like CDS spreads |
| Delayed reporting | Combined fiscal (slow) and market (fast) indicators |
